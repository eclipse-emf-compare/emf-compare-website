This project plan inherits from the Modeling Project Plan,
which should be referenced when consulting this individual project plan.

    <target_environments>
      <html:div>
In order to remain current, each Eclipse release targets reasonably current versions of the underlying operating environments. 
The EMF Compare project depends upon on the Platform,which is mostly "pure" Javaâ„¢. The 4.3 release of the Eclipse Platform Project 
is written and compiled against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs,  and targeted to run on version 1.5 of the Java Runtime Environment, Standard Edition. 
EMF Compare rely on EMF Core which is written and compiled against version 1.5 of the Java Platform APIs.,
EMF Compare relies on Java 5.<html:br/>
Eclipse Platform SDK 4.3 will be tested and validated on a number of reference platforms.<html:br/> 
EMF Compare  will be tested and validated against a subset of those listed for the platform.<html:br/>
<html:br/>
Given that there is no operating system dependent code in EMF Compare, it's expected that EMF Compare will work anywhere the Eclipse Platform does.
     </html:div>
     <internationalization>
          <html:div>
The Eclipse Platform is designed as the basis for internationalized products. 
The user interface elements provided by the Eclipse SDK components, 
including dialogs and error messages, are externalized.<html:br/> 
The English strings are provided as the default resource bundles.<html:br/> 
Similarly, the EMF Compare project will externalize all its user interface elements,
provide English strings for them in its default bundles, 
and localize a subset of the locales offered by the Platform.<html:br/> 
The download page will provide the details as they become available.
          </html:div>
     </internationalization>
   </target_environments>
   
   <compatibility_with_previous_releases>
       <html:div>
EMF Compare 2.0 was a full overhaul of the project, including its design and architecture.<html:br/>
As such, the project's API is not compatible with its previous 1.* versions. Version 2.1 brings few API 
breakages and new features but is mostly compatible with 2.0 version. A migration guide
will be provided in order to ease the adoption effort to this new version.<html:br/>

EMF Compare is developped with and targets the following projects :
    <html:ul>
      <html:li>
        Eclipse Platform SDK version 4.3
      </html:li>
      <html:li>
        EMF Core 2.9
      </html:li>
    </html:ul>
The ultimate EMF Compare release will be compatible with the released version of its dependencies
and will publish binary and source compatibilities with migration guides on subsequent releases.
