		<h2 id="Project_names_and_location">Project names and location</h2>
		<p>
			<b>Project names should match their location</b>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Cause">Cause</h3>
		<p>If you need to compare models that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>reference another model in the same project (or another project which also meets the following point), and</li>
			<li>are located in a project which name (as seen in their '.project' file) does not match their containing folder's name (case sensitive).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=354801">Bug 354801</a>, we cannot properly support models that are located in Eclipse projects which identifier is distinct from their containing folder, case included. For example, if you have a project named 
			<i>EcoreModels</i>, it 
			<b>must</b> be contained in a folder named 
			<i>EcoreModels</i>. Any other name, even if changing only the case, such as 
			<i>ecoreModels</i>, will cause issues when comparing fragmented models (or any model which references another).
		</p>
		<p>Note that this only applies to comparisons launched from within Eclipse, which would trigger the opening of the EMF Compare user interface.</p>
		<h3 id="Observed_Symptoms">Observed Symptoms</h3>
		<p>Symptoms vary, but they often include a NullPointerException somewhere in EMFSynchronizationModel such as :</p>
		<pre>Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

		<h2 id="Models_out_of_the_workspace">Models out of the workspace</h2>
		<p>
			<b>The models should be imported within the workspace</b>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Cause_2">Cause</h3>
		<p>Trying to compare models that are not present in the current Eclipse workspace from either the 
			<i>Git repositories</i> perspective, or from the 
			<i>Git Staging</i> view.
		</p>
		<p>Note that this only applies to comparisons launched from within Eclipse, which would trigger the opening of the EMF Compare user interface.</p>
		<h3 id="Observed_Symptoms_2">Observed Symptoms</h3>
		<p>Symptoms are mostly the same here as they would be with the limitation mentionned above regarding project names, and they usually include the same NullPointerException:</p>
