		<p>The following displays the important part of a model life cycle with regards to the comparison. The full life cycle can be followed on 
			<a href="./sample-use-case.html" title="./sample-use-case.html">Sample Use Case</a>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Compare_with_latest">Compare with latest</h4>
		<p>For this test, we'll suppose that you are trying to use EMF Compare on UML models shared under git. This will not go in details about UML and Git. We'll assume that you know how to manipulate an UML model, create or clone a git repository, share a project under it and use standard Git operations.</p>
		<p>The name of our sample project will be "library". It contains a single folder "model" containing two models :</p>
		<ul>
			<li>library_Types.uml will contain our primitive types,</li>
			<li>library.uml will contain our actual model.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The model itself is a very simple library. Graphically speaking :</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Model.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>We commit this initial file as the original model. We then slightly modify it so that it now looks like :</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Model_Changed.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>But how do we know exactly what changed? Let's compare this with the file from the Git Index :</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This will open a comparison editor. Let's select one of the differences displayed on its top half :</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_3.png"/>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>We've selected the difference corresponding to the addition of attribute 
				<b>alias</b> in the class 
				<b>Writer</b>. A double-click on this difference updated our two panes below.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>alias</b> has been added to the properties of Class 
				<b>Writer</b>. In the model, this corresponds to a change to the reference 
				<i>ownedAttributes</i> of the 
				<i>Writer</i> Class. This sub-panel indicates the actual reference that was changed in oder to remind us of the context.
			</li>
			<li>This displays all values of the reference outlined in (2) as they are in the 
				<i>left</i> model. This is where we see the new value, 
				<b>alias</b> outlined.
			</li>
			<li>As for (2), this will display the context of the selected difference. The same reference will usually be displayed in both (2) and (4).</li>
			<li>This panel displays all values of the reference outlined in (4) as they are in the 
				<i>right</i> model. In here, we see the location of 
				<b>alias</b> outlined as an empty space. This rectangle is where the new value will be added if we merge it. 
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>In this case, it is possible to merge towards the 
			<i>right</i> : the 
			<i>index</i> version of the model is editable, like any other file in the index. If we merge this difference towards the 
			<i>right</i>, then it will exist an 
			<i>unstaged</i> version of the model, and a 
			<i>staged</i> version of the model, that will include the merged difference.
		</p>
		<p>But this comparison with index is mainly useful in order to determine exactly what changed in our version. Let's commit our changes on the 
			<i>master</i> branch.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Compare_two_differing_branches">Compare two differing branches</h4>
		<p>After that, our model can evolve, and evolve separately in multiple branches. Let's consider the case where we would have a 
			<i>master</i> branch differing from a 
			<i>borrowables</i> branch such as the two look like this (the branching point was the model we've already displayed above) :
		</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
			<tr>
				<th align="center">Master</th>
				<th align="center">Borrowables</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_Master.png"/>
				</td>
				<td>
					<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_5.png"/>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Before we continue working on our Borrowables branch, we'd like to retrieve all modifications that have been pushed to master. With the "Borrowables" branch checked out, we'll use the 
			<i>Compare With &gt; Branch, Tag or Reference</i> action :
		</p>
		<p>
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_With_Master_1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>and compare with master :</p>
		<p>
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Use_Compare_With_Master_2.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>This shows us all differences between our local copy and the master branch that were made since the 'branching' point.</p>
		<p>
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Merge.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Same as previously, you can navigate through the differences via the top panel, the structural view. There are three main kind of elements displayed here. 
			<b>Regular</b> elements, that mimic the containment tree of your input models, are there to separate the various differences and let you know where they were actually detected. Then there are 
			<b>incoming</b> differences, decorated with a blue arrow (
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Incoming_Change.gif"/>) or a derived icon, and 
			<b>outgoing</b> differences decorated with a gray arrow (
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Outgoing_Change.gif"/>) or a derived icon.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Incoming</b> differences are changes that were made in the remote branch (here, 
			<i>master</i>) since the branching point (common ancestor).

			<b>Outgoing</b> differences are changes taht were made in the local copy (here, the 
			<i>borrowables</i> branch) since the branching point.
		</p>
		<p>There are no conflicts here, since UML uses computed identifiers (XMI ID) for the model elements. Thus, what looks like a conflict (the "Date" type that's been added on both branch in the types packages) is actually two distinct differences.</p>
		<p>The interface also lets you display the common ancestor of both models through the 
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Ancestor.gif"/> icon. For example, if we select the 
			<b>Book</b> class, we can see how it looks like on all three versions :
		</p>
		<p>
			<img align="middle" border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Merge_Book_Ancestor.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You can navigate through the differences using the appropriate actions, either the previous (
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Prev_Diff.gif"/>) or the next (
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Next_Diff.gif"/>) difference.
		</p>
		<p>The remaining two actions are those that actually interest us here we can either accept all non-conflicting differences to the local copy through 
			<img border="0" src="./../images/accept_all_changes.gif"/> or accept them one after the other through 
			<img border="0" src="./../images/accept_change.gif"/>.
		</p>
		<p>Accept 
			<b>all</b> differences is not what we seek : we want to keep the changes we made locally, not revert them to the state they had before the branching point (which is their current state on 
			<i>master</i>, the right side). We will then select all 
			<i>incoming</i> differences (under the 
			<i>Right side</i> node) one after the other and merge them one by one. This gives us our merged model :

		<h3 id="Filtering_Differences">Filtering Differences</h3>
		<p>This features allows you to filter differences out of the structural view according to a set predicate. By default, EMF Compare provides five distinct filters :</p>

		<h3 id="Handling_Conflicts">Handling Conflicts</h3>
		<p>When a 3-way comparison has conflicts, all differences involved in the same conflict are grouped under a Confict node.</p>
		<p>In the following case, the Employee Green has his manager reference in conflict. The left side of the comparison shows that the manager of the Employee Green is the employee Smith while the right side side shows that the manager is the Employee Johnson.
			The consequences of a merge from right to left of the selected difference are displayed.</p>
		<p>When the left side difference 
			<i>Employee Smith [ manager changed ]</i> is selected in the top panel, the right side difference 
			<i>Employee Johnson [ manager changed ]</i> is highlighted in red, that means if the the left side difference 
			<i>Employee Smith [ manager changed ]</i> is merged from right to left, then it will be impossible to merge the right side difference 
			<i>Employee Johnson [ manager changed ]</i> from left to right.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Handling_Conflict_1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>After the merge of the left side difference from right to left 
			<i>Employee Smith [ manager changed ]</i>, the right side difference 
			<i>Employee Johnson [ manager changed ]</i> is not "mergeable" from left to right anymore, it has been merged from right to left automatically.

		<h3 id="Graphical_Comparison">Graphical Comparison</h3>
		<p>EMF compare provides the ability to compare models with Papyrus graphical modeler (GMF Diagrams). To get the graphical comparison, the 
			<i>EMF Compare Papyrus integration</i> feature and Papyrus have to be installed.
			The graphical comparison will be launched if you compare diagrams files (.di), or if you compare models that have diagrams associated in the same folder.
			In the same way as the semantic model comparison, the graphical model comparison uses the same color coding, to distinguish <span style="color:blue">incoming</span> and <span style="color:gray">outgoing</span> changes, and <span style="color:red">conflicts</span>. To put in relief the graphical differences, some decorators are used:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>On one hand, to focus on the impacted objects, identifying them with markers. These markers are simple transparent rectangles which are set down above the concerned objects and are lightly larger.</li>
			<li>On the other hand, through phantoms (place-holders), to locate either the place where objects were deleted or the target location where objects should be added after merging.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The color of the concerned decorators are highlighted on selection of the difference.</p>
		<p>In the following example, a 3-way comparison is run with UML class diagrams. We can see that a Shape associated to a semantic uml class named A has been added on the left side of the comparison. After selected the difference in top panel, we can see the concerned elements in down panels. In the left part, the Shape A is highlighted in gray because it is an incoming change. In the right part, a phantom is drawn at the place the Shape should be after merging from right to left.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Graphical_AddClassA.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>About phantoms (place-holders):</p>
		<p>To ease their readability, in some cases, their context have to be displayed:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If they are nested in an other phantom (e.g. due to a delete of the parent object), this last contextual one is displayed at the same time as the main phantom concerned by the current selected change.</li>
			<li>If they are edges connected to deleted nodes or edges, these last contextual ones are displayed at the same time as the main edge phantom.</li>
			<li>The color of the contextual phantoms (dependencies) is not highlighted.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>They are drawn as:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A simple rectangle for nodes, at the same origin location (and size).</li>
			<li>A simple line (with the same bend points) for edges, at the same location.</li>
			<li>A simple line for nodes as element of containment list. For this case, the same LCS computation will be used to locate in the list, at the good index.</li>
			<li>Particular cases: If the location of the contextual phantoms was changed, the new location of the main phantom is computed.
				<ul>
					<li>A node place-holder, related to a delete of a node, embedded in a node where the location changed.</li>
					<li>An edge place-holder between nodes where the location changed. In this case, the display of the line is drawn again.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Here is an example of nested phantom:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the first capture represent an addition of a lifeline in sequence diagram.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Graphical_Phantom.gif"/>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the second capture represent an addition of an execution inside the lifeline. We can see the phantom of the execution element, which is highlighted and the phantom of the lifeline parent, which is not highlighted. </li>
		</ul>
		<p>

		<h3 id="Logical_Model">Logical Model</h3>
		<p>EMF Compare does not act simply on the selected files, but on their whole logical model (a given model can be split through multiple files through EMF 
			<i>control</i> action). Thanks to that, if you try and compare a model file that reference other model files, the comparison will still be able to take these "other" files into account. For example, if you try and compare a 
			<i>genmodel</i> file (that depends on its underlying 
			<i>ecore</i> file) :
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_Logical_Compare_Action.png"/>

		<h3 id="UML_Specialization">UML Specialization</h3>
		<p>A specific work has been done with EMF Compare for UML. It consists in an additionnal filter named 
			<b>UML refined elements</b>. This filter is active by default when a comparison involves UML resources.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_UML_Filter.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The filter groups UML consistant differences together in one difference. For example, a UML association is modeled by an association element and several sub-elements:</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_UML_Association.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>If EMF Compare detects a change on an element of type association, it will group all changes on the sub-elements of the assocation to the association difference.
			The goal of this filter is to ease the merge of differences. Indeed, all you have to do is to merge the association difference and it will merge all the sub-differences with it.</p>
		<p>Here is the comparison of two UML model, one with an association (the left side), another whithout (the right side). The 
			<b>UML refined elements</b> filter has been deactivated:

		<p>
			<img border="0" src="./../images/EMF_Compare_UML_Association_2.png"/>

		<h3 id="Project_names_and_location">Project names and location</h3>
		<p>
			<b>Project names should match their location</b>
		</p>
		<h4 id="Cause">Cause</h4>
		<p>If you need to compare models that:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>reference another model in the same project (or another project which also meets the following point), and</li>
			<li>are located in a project which name (as seen in their '.project' file) does not match their containing folder's name (case sensitive).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to 
			<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=354801">Bug 354801</a>, we cannot properly support models that are located in Eclipse projects which identifier is distinct from their containing folder, case included. For example, if you have a project named 
			<i>EcoreModels</i>, it 
			<b>must</b> be contained in a folder named 
			<i>EcoreModels</i>. Any other name, even if changing only the case, such as 
			<i>ecoreModels</i>, will cause issues when comparing fragmented models (or any model which references another).
